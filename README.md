### Silas, if you're reading this.

I know very little about github but you can click on "Repositories". Inside there should be a repository with my username, peruna77. 
(Or you can just click on this link to get there https://github.com/peruna77/peruna77 )

There should be an "issues" page where you can submit issues, you can write anything there that you want.
(Again, link to the issues page just in case you can't find it https://github.com/peruna77/peruna77/issues )

LASTLY - I have created this site which if you can open you should be able to edit the text box and I'll see anything you write there.
